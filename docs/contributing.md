# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Typical ways to extend the suite:

- add a new benchmark within an existing series (N, S, P, L, E, A),
- add a completely new series for a novel constraint dimension,
- contribute teaching notebooks or visualization utilities,
- add reference mappings or analysis scripts for specific hardware.

Guidelines:

- keep benchmarks small enough to run on a laptop GPU or CPU,
- document the purpose and design intent of each benchmark,
- favor simple, readable models over highly optimized or obscure architectures.
